OLTP - Online transaction processing  
OLAP - Online analytical processing 

- Database normalization. Organizing the attributes of tables in a realational database to minimize redundancy. 

- Normalization usually involves dividing large tables into smaller (and less redundant) tables, and defining relationships between them. 

Normal Form
    1st Normal Form (1NF)
    2nd Normal Form (2NF)
    3rd Normal Form (3NF)

1st Normal Form
    - Identify a unique primary key
    - Have just one set of values per column
    - Have just one value per cell
    - Eliminate repeating data

2nd Normal Form
    - Is in 1st Normal Form
    - Eliminate partial primary key dependenceis 
    - Non-key columns must depend on all keys of the componsite primary key

3rd Normal Form
    - Is in 1st Normal Form
    - Is in 2nd Normal Form
    - Eliminate transitive dependencies (columns that depends on another non-primary key column)

        "Every non-key attribute must be depend on the key, the whole key and nothing but the key"
