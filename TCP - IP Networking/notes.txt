    DNS
        Domain name --> IP adress

        1. Browser check local cache for domain name resolution
        2. Request to resolver server (ISP provided) for domain name resolution
        3. Checks root server. Top of DNS heierarcy. IF NOT  
            3.1 Root server will redirect the resolver to a top level domain (tld) server
            3.2 The TLD server will redirect the resolver to a authoritative name server. ANSWER 
            3.3 Resolver will store in cache ...  

        Resolver server
        Top level domain server (TDL)
        Authoritative name server

        Common DNS records types
            • A 
                Adress records (A record). Map names to IPv4 addressed. Used to implement the "address book" functionality of DNS
            • AAAA
                IPv6 address records. Map names to IPv6 addresses. Used to extend the "address book" functionality of DNS to support IPv6. Quad-A nomenclature reflects that fact that 128-bit IPv6 addresses are 4 time the length of 32-bit IPv4 addresses
            • CNAME
                Canonical name record. Used to implement DNS aliases, where a record maps to another name. Aliases 
            • MX
                Mail eXcahnge record. Specifies the name of the mail server responsilble for handling incoming email for a given domain
            • NS 
                Name server record. Specifices the authoritative name server(s) for a domain
            • PTR 
                Pointer record. Maps IP addresses to fully quanlified domain names. Opposite of A or AAAA records 
            • SOA
            • SRV
            • TXT

    TCP
          1. synchronize (syn)
