What is and how does full stack work? (with respect to the MEAN stack)

The idea of full stack or being a full stack developer is to be able to build web applications. So this means the ability to not only do static websites that are just front end but also add functionality to the website. To make buttons and forms that work. It also means having the ability to display data which was previously submitted by forms and is stored in a database. 

To explan the layers in the means stack we can think about backend and front end. On the back end you have a data base. In the case of the MEAN stack MongoDB. You then write API's (restful API's in the case of node.js) which can operate on the data base. These can be get, post, put and delete. You then interact on the front end with the API using ajax to
